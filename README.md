# Project Description

My project is a Bitcoin price visualizer that works by collecting quotes from finviz.com/crypto.ashx and displaying them through a line chart, a table, and an additional customized view. I selected this as my project because I use the Stocks app on my phone all the time, and I would like to build an app to trade in the Ecuadorian stock market one day.
